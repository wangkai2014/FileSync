# FileSync
A small program to keep your external storage in sync.

# Future features and improvements

- Have an actual UI...

- Turn computer off when done (or sleep, hibernate, execute powershell script, ...)

- Sync over network

- Show progress based on file size, not count

- Black list files by name/extension/size

- Compare even common files to propose to copy the most recent one on both sides

- Make recursivity optional by individual folder map

- Add an option to "install" the tool on external drives (will copy itself at the new drive's root)

- Log every operation on files (copy, deletion, overwrite)

- Keep an history of last few syncs in case we lose something (at least we would know who to blame...)

- Add an icon

# Known bugs

- Rewrite in progress, no known bugs yet.
